# fully-foss-icons
Public domain icons for the world to use. 

While these are public domain, we kindly ask you do credit us in a way you feel is apropriate, and do not sell the content. 

All icons are created on a 24x24 canvas, like simpleicons.org. 

ONLY PATHS MAY BE USED IN FINAL SVG'S. Every point must be exactly on a pixel (SHIFT+5 in inkscape to toggler pixel snap). Draw points into the shape, then CTRL+A on points, make selected segments curves, and adjust so it looks good. 

A standard corner is a point, then 2px in both x and y away is another point forming a diaginal. We then turn those into curves and drag them towards each other, making a clean curve. 

You must ALWAYS leave a 1px padding around the outside (making the effective canvas 22x22). You almost always must leave a 1px padding around every object.

Objects are to be filled with #000000.
